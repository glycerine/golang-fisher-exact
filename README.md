# golang-fisher-exact

Fisher's exact test for 2x2 contingency tables, in Golang (Go).

Ported from the C/C++ at https://github.com/gatoravi/fisher-exact

MIT licensed.

Update: I'd recommend https://github.com/glycerine/fisherexact over
this version now. It is
very similar, but with patches for extreme value handling from htslib, and a chi-squared
test included too. Plus an introduction to using the FET.
